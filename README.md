Reacreating the google homepage structure and stylings to practice basic HTML and CSS. Odin Project mini-project.
Will update on experience once completed.

Note 1: Next time don't try to do everything by percentage to make it responsive... It doesn't seem to work like that. 
Instead go by px for the most part and use the media queries to adapt to different screen dimensions instead. 

Note 2: When using flex, perhaps set the body to display: flex; at the start.
